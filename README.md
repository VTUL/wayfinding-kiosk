# Kiosk Wayfinding App

This app is an active wayfinding system to be used on kiosks with vector graphic maps for buildings. It was originally written for use in Newman Library at Virginia Tech, but could be adapted to work in any building.

Video tutorial on how to get this system up and running will be posted soon.
